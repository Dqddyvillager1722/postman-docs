You can stay on top of your API deployments in Postman by connecting to AWS API Gateway. With this integration, you can view your API deployment status and history directly within Postman.

## Connecting deployment services to Postman

Postman currently offers a deployment integration with AWS API Gateway. Follow the [Postman Public Roadmap](http://go.pstmn.io/public-roadmap) for details on upcoming releases.

### Connecting to AWS API Gateway

To connect your deployment service to Postman, navigate to your API in Postman by selecting APIs from the left sidebar, then selecting your API and a version to view. Select the **Deployments** tab, then **AWS API Gateway**.

To connect to AWS API Gateway, you can either [authenticate by creating an AWS IAM role](#authenticating-with-an-aws-iam-role) or [authenticate by using an AWS access key](#authenticating-with-an-aws-access-key).

#### Authenticating with an AWS IAM role

To set up a connection to AWS API Gateway with an AWS IAM role, select **IAM** from the dropdown list under **AWS Authentication Mechanism**.

<img alt="Connecting with AWS IAM role" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/connect-to-api-gateway-with-iam-role-v9.jpg" width="400px"/>

Provide a **Name** for your integration and select the **AWS API Type**.

Next, create an IAM role for Postman in AWS:

1. Navigate to your [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) and select **Create role**.
2. Under **Select type of trusted entity**, select **Another AWS account**.
3. Enter Postman's Account ID: `258201882842`.
4. Under options, check the box to **Require external ID** and enter the external ID Postman has provided.
    > Refer to the [AWS IAM guide on using external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) for more information.
5. Select **Next: Permissions**.
6. Choose the existing IAM policy or **Create policy**. If creating, submit the following JSON:

    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "Stmt909923626743",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "apigateway:GET"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

7. Select **Next: Tags**.
8. Select **Next: Review**.
9. Add a **Role name** and **Role description**, then **Create Role**.

Copy the **Role ARN** from AWS and paste it in Postman under **Step 2: Enter role ARN and region**. Then, enter the **AWS Region**, select the **API Gateway**, and select **Connect** to connect Postman to AWS API Gateway.

#### Authenticating with an AWS access key

To set up a connection to AWS API Gateway with an AWS access key, select **Access Key** from the dropdown list under **AWS Authentication Mechanism**.

<img alt="Connecting with AWS access key" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/connect-to-api-gateway-with-access-key.jpg" width="400px"/>

Provide the following information to connect to AWS API Gateway:

* Enter a **Name** for your integration.
* Select the **AWS API Type**.
* Enter your **Access Key ID**.
* Enter your **Secret Access Key**.
* Add your **AWS Region**.

> Refer to the [AWS guide on credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html) for more information on locating your access key ID and secret access key.

Select **Connect** to connect Postman to AWS API Gateway.

## Viewing API deployments in Postman

To view your API deployments in Postman, navigate to your API version and select the **Deployments** tab.

<img alt="Deployed APIs" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/api-gateway-deployments-configured.jpg"/>

Here you can view details about your various API deployments, including all of the stages over which your APIs are deployed. Within each stage, you can view the invoke URL, access logs, and execution logs. Within each deployment, you can view the IDs, descriptions, creation dates, and current statuses.

Select **View Dashboard** in the upper right to open your AWS dashboard.

To edit or delete the integration, select the <img alt="Three dots icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg" width="18px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:5px"> in the upper right.
