> __[The Postman Enterprise Application is only available to Postman Enterprise teams and is currently in beta.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)__

Postman's Enterprise Application is a variant of Postmanâ€™s Desktop Application that offers greater control to administrators looking to deploy Postman at an enterprise level. It is available as an MSI package for Windows and supports silent installation, system-wide installation, and additional configurations to control how Postman is installed on users' devices.

To get started, reach out to your Postman Account Manager or [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).

## Installing the Postman Enterprise app

Once you've downloaded the Postman Enterprise MSI package, you can move forward with installing the app.

### INSTALLDIR

The `INSTALLDIR` public property is used to select a custom installation directory. If this public property is not manually overwritten, it defaults to `%PROGRAMFILES%\Postman\"Postman Enterprise"` for system-wide installations and `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Postman\"Postman Enterprise"` for per-user installations.

For example, you can run the following command to perform a system-wide installation to a custom directory:

```
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi INSTALLDIR=C:\custom
```

### MSIINSTALLPERUSER

The standard `MSIINSTALLPERUSER` option is used to install the application per-user instead of system-wide. By default, the MSI performs a system-wide installation. Set `MSIINSTALLPERUSER` to `1` to perform a per-user installation.

For example, you can run the following command to perform a per-user installation to the default installation directory:

```
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1
```

This public property can be used in conjunction with `INSTALLDIR` to perform a per-user installation to a custom directory:

```
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1 INSTALLDIR=%USERPROFILE%\custom
```

### Silent installation

A silent installation or uninstallation is performed by passing the `/qn` option to `msiexec`:

```
msiexec /i path\to\package.msi /qn MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1
```

Note that running in silent installation mode will omit error messages. If the installation fails for any reason, `%ERRORLEVEL%` will not equal `0` but no error will be displayed.

It is always recommended to [run silent installations with logging enabled](#enabling-verbose-logging-for-installation).

### Enabling verbose logging for installation

The `msiexec` tool can be configured to output debug log information about the installation process with the `/l*v` option. For example, you can output debug information to `C:\log.txt`:

```
msiexec /i path\to\package.msi /l*v C:\log.txt
```

## Updating the Postman Enterprise app

To upgrade the Postman Enterprise app, you can install the new version of the MSI package. Windows Installer will recognize this updated installation as an upgrade.

You must pass the exact same public properties that were used when you originally installed Postman Enterprise.

For example, if you first installed Postman Enterprise with the following you must install the new MSI package in the same way:

```
INSTALLDIR=C:\custom and MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1
```

> Downgrading the Postman Enterprise app is not supported and attempts to do so will result in an error message. You can force a downgrade by manually removing the current version and then installing an older version of Postman Enterprise.

## Uninstalling the Postman Enterprise app

The `msiexec` command-line tool can be used to remove an existing application using the `/x` option:

```
msiexec /x path\to\package.msi  
```

The application can also be removed from the Add/Remove Programs section in system settings or from the system Control Panel application.
